Sequence - object in DB that return numbers one by one

- To create sequence:
create sequence sequence_name

- To get next number from sequence:
select nextval('sequence_name')

- To create table with sequence:
create table Person(
    id SERIAL,
    name varchar,
    age int,
    email varchar
);
- SERIAL - is a pseudo-type of sequence (syntax sugar - we don't need to create sequence)
- Next time we insert values there is no need to set value to id - nextval will be called automatically
INSERT VALUES Person VALUES('Abobus', 13, 'sus@gmail.com')

!!! ATTENTION !!!
- SERIAL IS AN OLD SYNTAX. IN NEW VERSIONS:
create table Person(
    id int GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY
    name varchar,
    age int,
    email varchar
);
- Why?
This syntax is used in other SQLs, so PostgreSQL devs decided to make it that way.
