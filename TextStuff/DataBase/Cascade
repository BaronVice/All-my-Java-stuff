What happens when we try to delete a record, value of which used in another table?
- Answer: error will be raised.

Now how actually referenced value is created:
- At first sight: user_id int References Person(user_id)
- Actually it is: user_id int References Person(user_id) ON DELETE RESTRICT

ON DELETE - describes behavior of how table should react when referenced value is deleted
There are three behaviors:
1) Restrict (default) - raise error when is called for delete
2) Cascade - when referenced value is deleted whole bonded record deleted as well
3) Set null - deleted value is replaced with null
