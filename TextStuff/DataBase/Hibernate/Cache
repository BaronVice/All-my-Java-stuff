There is a thing called Hibernate cache that is synchronized by Hibernate from time to time.
It means that when we build connection from one side - it will be written in SQL, but the other side will get this
connection only a while ago. So, it's better to stick with accurate approach - when something happening with one
side, we should apply changes in other side. Using this approach we avoid problem of bad cache coherency.

...
    Person person = session.get(Person.class, "Bob");
    session.delete(person);
    person.getProducts.forEach(session::delete);
...

...
    Person person = new Person(...);
    Product product = new Product(..., person);
    session.save(product);
    person.getProducts().add(product);
...

It doesn't cause additional SQL request, but will keep Hibernate cache in order
