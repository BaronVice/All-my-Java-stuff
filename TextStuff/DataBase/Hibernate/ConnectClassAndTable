create table person(
    id int primary key generated by default as identity,
    name varchar(100),
    age int not null check ( age > 0 )
);

To connect class and table we have to insert some annotations:

@Entity
@Table(name="Person")
@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
public class Person {
    @Id
    @Column(name = "id")
    private int id;
    @Column(name = "name")
    private String name;
    @Column(name = "age")
    private int age;
}

@Entity - mark class if it should be scanned by hibernate
@Table(name="Person") - with what table in DB should be associated with this class
@Id - to indicate primary key
@Column(name="id") - with what column in table should be associated this field
