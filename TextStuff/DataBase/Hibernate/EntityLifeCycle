There are four states of entity lifecycle:
1) Transient
2) Persistent (Managed)
3) Detached
4) Removed

- Transient
When object is created, but not saved in Hibernate cache:
...
    Person person = new Person(...);
...

It becomes
- Persistent
When we save it in session and commit session:
...
    Person person = new Person(...);
    session.save(person);
    session.getTransaction.commit();
...
or when we take object from Hibernate with session.get()

- Detached
After session.detach(someObj) hibernate is not watching for any detached object changes.
Its kinda transient, but can be returned to persistent with session.merge(someObj).
Another condition of object being detached - closing hibernate session

- Removed
Object deleted in session followed by commit:
...
    Person person = session.get(...);
    session.delete(person);
    session.getTransaction.commit();
...
