For specific tasks hand-made requests required:
1) Print every person with age > 20
2) Delete all topics which name begins with "Faq"
3) Update all employees by increasing their salaries for 300 bucks
4) ...

Difference between SQL and HQL:
SQL: SELECT * FROM Person WHERE name = "SomeName"
HQL: FROM Person WHERE name = "SomeName"

In SQL there is communication with tables, in HQL - with classes

Purposes of HQL:
1) Communicate with entities (Java classes), not entities
2) Can be converted to SQL
3) Easier for complex requests
4) Usually, Spring app is a combination of Hibernate and Non-common SQL requests
