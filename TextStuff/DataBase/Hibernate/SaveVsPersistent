These two methods almost have no difference, but...

.save() VS .persistent()
(JPA - Java Persistence API)
1) Hibernate method, you wont find it in other JPA libraries - From JPA specifications (any JPA provider implements it)
2) Returns primary key of saved entity - Void return
3) Guaranteed that primary key will be defined when .save() is called - primary key will be defined but maybe not right
after .persistent() is called

But all other details almost has no difference
