Let's say we have a table transaction with 5M records:

| record_id | transaction_date | amount | transaction_type | bank_account_id |
    some           values         lay          inside             table

And we'd like to make requests:
SELECT * FROM transaction WHERE amount > 100000

Man, you know Big O - 5M operations is required to execute it. Moreover this kind of request will be sent frequently
And as a competitive programmer you programmer you will come to solution:
1) Sort (n*log(n) once)
2) Use bin search (log(n) every request, which is much better than just n)

In that case you want to create Index for amount.
Index - sorted values bonded with primary key. It means that when you need to execute something with amount - it
will be done not inside table, but in Index.

Pros: SPEEEEEEEEEEEED
Cons: memory...
