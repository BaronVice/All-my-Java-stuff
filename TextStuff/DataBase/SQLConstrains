Let's say there is a Person table:
CREATE TABLE Person(
    id int GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
    name varchar,
    age int,
    email varchar
);

So what are the restrictions:
id - should be unique and not NULL,
name - not NULL
age - age > 0
email - unique

Most popular constrains are:
1) NOT NULL
2) UNIQUE
3) PRIMARY KEY (this is both UNIQUE and NOT NULL)
4) FOREIGN KEY
5) CHECK

With constrains:
CREATE TABLE Person(
    id int GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    name varchar NOT NULL,
    age int CHECK (age > 0),
    email varchar UNIQUE
);
