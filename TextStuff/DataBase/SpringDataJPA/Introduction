Mostly used technologies for DB management:
1) Spring Data JPA
2) ORM (Hibernate)
- These are high-level abstractions that are frequently used as they contain most common requests

3) JdbcTemplate
4) JDBC API
- The last two are for advanced requests

-- Example --
Hibernate DAO:

@Component
@AllArgsConstructor(onConstructor = @__(@Autowired))
public class TeacherDAO {
    private final SessionFactory sessionFactory;

    // Lot of lines...
}

Spring Data JPA Repository (kinda DAO):

@Repository
public interface TeachersRepository extends JpaRepository<Teacher, Integer>{
}

@Service
public class TeacherService(){
    // some code as in dao, but easier
}
