1) Every test case is a separate method, which should be annotated as @Test
2) @Before -
   @BeforeClass -
   @After -
   @AfterClass -
3) Test class name should end with "Test" (example: "Vector2DTest")
4) It is recommended to name test methods with "should" (example: "sumShouldBePositive")

What @Test do:
- Defines method (which must be public void) as a test method
What parameters could be used with @Test?
1) expected - when we want to check for some throwing exception (so this exception is expected)
2) timeout - we may make some time bound for test execution (if exceeded, then test is failed)


org.junit.Assert (is a check for "expected"/"actual")
Methods:
assertTrue() - if method returned True
assertFalse() - if method returned False
assertEquals() - if expected is equal to actual
assertArrayEquals() - same as above, but for arrays
assertNotEquals() - if expected is not equal to actual
fail() - auto fail
