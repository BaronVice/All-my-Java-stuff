Test case - artifact which describes steps and conditions, that are needed for testing some functionality
Test case: Action -> Expected result -> Test result
Example: Open page "login" -> Login page is opened -> Test passed

Testing levels:
1) Module test - testing specified modules like classes and methods (that what developers are usually do)
2) Integration test - if modules are compatible
3) System test - testing the whole project (that what testers are usually do)

What is test capable for?
1) Recreating some data / precompile some actions
2) Runs test method and send its result
3) Compare result and what was expected (this process is called assert).
Then it's either "Test passed" or "Test failed" (often it just throws AssertionError)

Why is it needed?
1) Make sure we develop modules for specific purpose (there is also paradigm called Test Driven Development)
So tests before code, as we want our program to match every clients requirement
2) Preventing errors and bugs after bringing new features
3) Test shows specifications (again, Test Driven Development)
