Open System Interconnection model - describes rules how data is transferred in network
There are 7 layers of data transfer

--- First three are Media layers: they send info through network with use of its devices ---
1) Physical layer (Ethernet) - how data is transferred between two physical devices (channel of bits goes through
optical fiber or something wireless like WI-FI, Bluetooth, 4G etc.).
2) Data link layer (Ethernet) - here chanel of bits is turned into frame with sender and receiver addresses which later
are sent by switch. On this layer ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is actively used for comparing MAC and IP, as well
as encapsulating and decapsulating data.
3) Network layer (ICMP) - router gets frame from switch and builds rout to receiver considering potential network
problems.

--- The rest four are Host layers: used not in network, but devices ---
4) Transport layer - bridge between Media and Host layers. Its role is to deliver packages. There are two protocols
of sending packages:
    TCP - for sensitive data, when losses are unacceptable, packages divided on segments.
    UDP - usually used for videos, when delay is critical, packages divided on datagrams.
    * key difference of datagram - it is autonomous each datagram contains headers which are used to reach receiver.
      Thereby they are independent from network.

5) Session layer - name speaks for itself. Open/close session, provide task synchronization. Implemented in environments
that imply calculation on multiple devices/OS.
6) Presentation layer - transforms protocols, data code/decode/encryption (if required).
7) Application layer - that's a sort of interface for user. It's not about routing or ensure data delivery. But to
present user the data in required format (HTTP is an example)

TCP/IP is same as OSI, but Session and Presentation layers are encapsulated in Application layer.
* OSI is a concept, while TCP/IP is a real protocol that is used on practice.
