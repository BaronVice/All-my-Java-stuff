Things to avoid:
1. Arriving late
2. Dressing inappropriately
3. Speaking negatively about former employer
(keep tone between neutral and positive, what you've learned and what hoping in the future)
4. Avoiding eye contact (speaks about your confidence)
5. Early salary discussion
(salary compensation or holidays is better to discuss after offer is on the table)
