Things to remember:
1. Arrive in time
2. Dress decently
3. Keep tone neutral or positive about former employer.
Think what you've learned from previous job and what you're hoping in the future.
4. Keep your eye contact (as it speaks about your confidence)
5. Do NOT discuss salary early
(salary compensation or holidays is better to discuss after offer is on the table)
