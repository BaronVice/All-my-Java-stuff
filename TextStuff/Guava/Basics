Optional - same idea as java.util.Optional (still, they are different and last is more preferable). Optional removes
headache of null checkers as well as it makes code more neat

Precondition - more of checkers (conditions, array elements, nulls, etc)

Ordering - wrapper of Comparator or Comparator with extended functionality

Objects - haven't tested it due to its deprecation (same as with Optional - already implemented from Java 8)
