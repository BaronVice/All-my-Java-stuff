Abstract class - class you can't instantiate (make sense when it's not right to instantiate something undefined)
Abstract class may have any sort of methods (expect private abstract, as it has no sense)
Abstract class enforce and organize what every subclass must have

Difference between Abstract class and interface:
1) Every interface method is abstract
2) Class may implement any number of interfaces, but extend only one class
3) Every interface field static and final (so you have instantiated it)
