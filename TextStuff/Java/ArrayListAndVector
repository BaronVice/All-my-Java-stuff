ArrayList is quite same as Vector(Stone Age thing from the end of 20th century)

Why choose one over another?
1) ArrayList is better at performance (add 10**9 items and you'll get the difference)
2) Vectors operations are synchronized, but ArrayLists are not (try two threads of adding)

So ArrayList gets this boost from declining synchronization.
- In case we have multithreading stuff there are three options:
1) Vector<?> vector = new Vector<>();
2) List<?> list = new Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList());
3) Use synchronized block or lock on ArrayList operations

- What shall we do with vectors?
- Use ArrayList
