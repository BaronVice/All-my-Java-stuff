In big projects we have to handle a lot of dependencies. There are two build formats for
java projects: .jar and .war. Sure we can handle dependencies, create project structure and compile
it manually. But there is a better solution - Apache Maven

Artifact - library or project which we can connect to our project
Dependency - outsource library
Apache Maven - tool for building projects and handling dependencies

Difference between java and maven projects - maven has specific structure and pom file where
we can handle dependencies (which maven automatically will connect to our project) and
project configuration (to .jar or .war)

Archetype - structure template
