Framework - platform that determines application structure, makes component development and integration easier
Spring is:
1) One of the most popular web-frameworks in the world
2) Most popular Java framework
3) Spring is used almost wherever Java used

Components:
1) Application Context & Dependency Injection
Java app - is a set of Java objects, which communicate with each other;
More complex app - more connections and dependencies becomes between objects.
Objects could be deleted/added in app while it's running. A lot of dependencies may be changed.
So Spring helps us to work with all of these connections.
- Application Context - Spring creates needed objects and handle them itself.
Created objects are stored inside Application Context.
- Dependency Injection - Spring create objects connection on his own. We just need to describe them.
2) More effective access to DB
- Provides a wide choice of tools to communicate with DB
3) Spring MVC - Java web-application component
- Allow to create Web-app
- Huge part Internet Web-apps are working on Spring MVC
- Also used as backend-API for mobile apps
4) And other useful components spring.io (Spring Security, Spring Boot, Spring Webflow, ...

How to configure Spring:
1) XML config file (old approach) - describe all stuff in .xml config file
set ClassPathXmlApplicationContext, then getBeans
2) Java annotations and a bit of XML (modern) - still with .xml but some instructions are replaced with annotations
same as previous but classes are marked with annotations
3) All from Java code (also modern) - only annotations and java config class
set AnnotationConfigApplicationContext, then getBeans
