Needed dependencies:
1) Spring core - literally application core
2) Spring beans - configuration framework and basic functionality to handle java objects
3) Spring context - allows get access to configured objects (context)

Package is the same as groupId.
.xml - allows to describe app configuration. Spring will read it and create bean (something like object)
xml stuff inside it is needed to use Spring framework.
Most important stuff here are beans:
id - unique identifier
class - root of this bean
value - value given to bean's constructor

ClassPathXmlApplicationContext - Standalone XML application context, taking the context definition files from
the class path, interpreting plain paths as class path resource names that include the package path
