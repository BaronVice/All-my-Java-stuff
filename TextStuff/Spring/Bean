Bean - is just a Java object, but created by Spring
They are created from Java classes (just like usual objects)

How it is used?
1) We create normal Java class (future beans)
2) Create and connect beans using Spring configuration file (annotations, XML or Java code)
3) When we want to use bean, we just take it from Spring container (easy)
