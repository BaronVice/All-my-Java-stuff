Data access object - pattern.
It's bad approach to connect model directly with DB. Instead of that we want to take it off in other class.
So DAO is for class that is acting with DB.

Before:
PeopleController -> Person(Model) <=> DB
After:
PeopleController <=> PersonDAO <=> DB
                         ^
                         L > Person


DAO classes usually contain SQL code
