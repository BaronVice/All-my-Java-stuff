From Spring 3 it is possible to use Java code instead of xml files.
To do this we have to create Java class which implements interface "org.springframework.web.WebApplicationInitializer":
or use "AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer" which is already implements interface above.

Spring config besides of @Configuration and @ComponentScan should also be annotated with @EnableWebMvc as now it
is a web application

One more dependency is required - Java Servlet API (used by abstract class)
