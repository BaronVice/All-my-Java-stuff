Spring app is usually used for sending sata, not sending .html pages. This is related to multiple services architecture
as they communicate with each other by sending data (usually JSON)

App (JS, IOS, Android, Python, ...) (HTTP request)-> Spring App (REST API)
Spring App (REST API) (Data) -> App (JS, IOS, Android, Python, ...)

Why REST API?
1) It allows to connect different components (other languages and frameworks)
2) And so many other services can send requests to our REST service
