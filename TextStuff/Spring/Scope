Scope - thing that specifies how Spring will create beans

Scopes:
Singleton (default) - created once and when is called by getBean() returns its link. Commonly used when bean
has no changeable states (stateless).
    <bean id="musicPlayerBean"
          class="baronvice.springstuff.musicplayer.MusicPlayer"
          scope="singleton">
        <constructor-arg ref="rockMusicBean"/>
    </bean>
- Not what we need to create multiple music players


Prototype - every getBean() call returns new object. Commonly used when bean has changeable states (stateful)
    <bean id="musicPlayerBean"
          class="baronvice.springstuff.musicplayer.MusicPlayer"
          scope="singleton">
        <constructor-arg ref="rockMusicBean"/>
    </bean>
- That's how multiple music players should be created


When Spring MVC will come:
Request
Session
Global-session
