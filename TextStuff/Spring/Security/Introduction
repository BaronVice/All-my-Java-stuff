- Spring Security is used for easier authentication and authorization
* Authentication - approve that I'm a person with some role
* Each role is authorized for some set of actions

- How Spring Security is integrated in app?
* With a use of filters - objects that catch all HTTP requests
HTTP request -> Security filters -> Spring app



- It's build this way:
                                 ------------------------
Authentication (Credentials) -> | AuthenticationProvider | -> Request to authentication server
                                |    authentication()    | -> Get principal from DB
Authentication (Principal)   <- |                        | -> etc.
                                 ------------------------

* Credentials - data to authenticate (login/password)
* Principal - data after successful authentication (user data)
* AuthenticationProvider - an interface to provide authentication
*
! Principal data is required for session, so no repeatable authentication needed for next requests.
Session is valid for a while and after some time authentication is needed again
