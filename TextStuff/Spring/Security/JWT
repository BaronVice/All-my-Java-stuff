JWT (JSON Web Token) - standard for securely transmitting data as a JSON object
Stateless tool allows user to store his own session and send JSON with his data on any microservice.

Process of JWT authentication:
1) Client logs in -> Server creates JWT on given credentials
2) Server sends encrypted JWT to client
3) Client sends auth request with JWT in header -> Server compares JWT
4) Server sends response on every subsequent request

Example:

- Encoded -

- Decoded -

HEADER:ALGORITHM & TOKEN TYPE
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}

PAYLOAD:DATA
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "iat": 1516239022
}

VERIFY SIGNATURE - verify sender and ensure that message wasn't changed
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
)
