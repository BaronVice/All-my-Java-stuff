Why Spring Boot?

Issues of Spring Framework:
1) A lot of configurations
2) Dependencies and their conflicts (instead of separate dependencies they all grouped in "starter`")
3) App compilation and its deploy

Spring Boot - is not "high-level" Spring, but one of its parts (like MVC, Data Jpa, Security, ...)

- Due to high-level abstractions hard-to-remove bugs may appear

@SpringBootApplication - contains annotations to configure everything (@Configuration, @ComponentScan, etc.)
Should be located in project root
