--- Why Spring Boot? ---

Issues of Spring Framework:
1) A lot of configurations
2) Dependencies and their conflicts (instead of separate dependencies they all grouped in "starter`")
3) App compilation and its deploy

Spring Boot - is not "high-level" Spring, but one of its parts (like MVC, Data Jpa, Security, ...)

- Due to high-level abstractions hard-to-remove bugs may appear

@SpringBootApplication - contains annotations to configure everything (@Configuration, @ComponentScan, etc.)
Should be located in project root


--- How to launch on server? ---
Another advantage - it has it's own server (no need to launch server and then load .war file)
- Steps to console launch:
1) Locate project directory
2) Build to .jar file with use of maven
    2.1) If there is no maven on server than in console either "./mvnw package" if it's Linux/MacOS
    or "mvnw package" in case of Windows
3) Go to target directory and launch .jar file: java -jar FileName.jar

- Shutdown is Ctrl+C
