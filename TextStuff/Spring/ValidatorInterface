Validation annotation offer simple checks.
When advanced validation required - Validator is used.

It's an interface and when implemented it allows to check if some object complies with requirements.

Example: if name is already used - reject it (not possible with annotations as they can't call DB)

@Component
@AllArgsConstructor(onConstructor = @__(@Autowired))
public class GameValidator implements Validator {

    private final GameDAO gameDAO;

    @Override
    public boolean supports(Class<?> aClass) {
        return Game.class.equals(aClass);
    }

    @Override
    public void validate(Object o, Errors errors) {
        Game game = (Game) o;
        if (gameDAO.show(game.getName()) != null)
            errors.rejectValue("name", "", "Game with this name is already exists");
    }
}

Also this validator should be injected inside controller (to manage responses if all fine or not).
