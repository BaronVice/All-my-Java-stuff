1) From constructor (send arguments straight to constructor)
    <bean id="musicPlayerBean"
          class="baronvice.springstuff.musicplayer.MusicPlayer">
        <constructor-arg ref="rockMusicBean"/>
    </bean>

2) From setter (firstly creates object with empty constructor, than set its values with setters)
    <bean id="musicPlayerSetterBean"
          class="baronvice.springstuff.musicplayer.MusicPlayer">
        <property name="music" ref="bluesMusicBean"/>
    </bean>

We can inject references (ref=) or just values (value=)
As well as values from external files. For this we'll need to create .properties file and fill it with
pairs keys=values (song.name = Paradise City). Now it is possible to call key from context (value = "${song.name}"

There is a lot of configurations (scope, init-method, destroy-method, factory method etc.)
Injection is possible from XML, Java-annotations, Java-code
Injections may be automatized with Autowiring
